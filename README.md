# Ray Tracing a Black Hole
This repository provides a black hole ray tracing method, i.e. using existing ray tracing technique and the theorem based on the general theory the Relativity, trying to render what "black hole" might looks like by tracking how a critical photon(light) goes.

## Implementations
These codes are written in C++ and the ray tracing technique comes from *Ray Tracing: The Next Week* yet additional method was added to play with some other concepts, e.g. necessary concepts of general theory the Relativity.
